	<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
		<p>
			The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked public web pages that are accessible through the internet. It contains a vast variety of documents, accessible by the user, that are all linked by hyperlinks. Hyperlinks highlight a word or phrase that redirects you to another document that provides further information about the word or phrase you originally clicked on. The WWW uses web servers, which are computer programs that store and transmit documents to other computers when requested. Clients are programs that request the documents from the server. Web browsers are software applications that allow the user to view and access the documents stored within the web, for example, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/" target="_blank" title="Google Chrome">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge" target="_blank" title="Microsoft Edge">Microsoft Edge</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/safari/" target="_blank" title="Safari">Safari</a>, and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" title="Firefox">Firefox</a>.
			
		</p>
	<h2>How is the World Wide Web different from the internet?</h2>
			<h3>The Web</h3>
			<p>
				The web is a system created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> in 1989, using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the coding language of web pages, standardising the communication between clients and servers. It serves as the world’s main service to retrieve information from the internet.

			<h3>The Internet</h3>
			<p>
				The internet is a global system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network" target="_blank" title="Networks">networks</a>, connecting computers and servers globally, being first developed in the mid 20th century, and became publicly available in the early 1900s. The internet is used for virtually any purpose that involves information and can be accessed by anyone that has a connection to a network. It has many ways of sharing information, such as the World Wide Web, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email" target="_blank" title="Email">email</a>, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging" target="_blank" title="Instant Messaging">instant messaging</a> services.
			</p>

			<p>
				Altogether, the WWW and the internet are two different technologies that vastly help internet users in accessing information. The WWW is just one part of the internet that works with it to provide information, entertainment and many other services to the public. The internet links every computer, and transports the information, and from this, the web stores it and allows you to access and use the information on web browsers.
			</p>
	<h2>What is an intranet?</h2>
		<p>
			An intranet is a software that is separate from but similar to the internet but still uses an internalised private network that is used for securely containing and sharing information. It relates to the internet because of how they both store and share information and give access to users to view it. They connect users and computers within a network, and also both use standard protocols, transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP), and both use web browsers. 
		</p>
			<h3>How does it relate to the internet?</h3>
				<p>
					Although the intranet is a lot more private, being restricted to a select amount of users, the internet is accessible by practically anyone globally. An intranet is useful for organisations as their information can be stored privately and securely from public eyes and provides only employees within the organisation with access to the information, and is owned by said organisation. Because of this, users within an intranet enjoy the benefits of a private network, i.e. the information can only be accessed by authorised computers within the network, a limited amount of users, limited amount of information for specific users, its own IP address for the network and users in the network, and an intranet is much safer and secure than the internet.
				</p>
	<h2>What is an internet protocol?</h2>
		<p>
			The Internet Protocol (IP), is a network layer communications protocol for routing and addressing data across networks. IP information is attached to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet" target="_blank" title="Packets">packets</a>, data which is divided into smaller pieces, and this information helps get the data within the packets, to its right destination on the internet. Every domain on the internet has an IP address, a unique identifier assigned to the device, which is where packets would be directed to. In order for data to be transported to where it is needed.
		</p>
		<h3>Compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP.</h3>
			<h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h4>
				<p>
					HTTP, the standard application layer protocol, is the protocol that stands as the foundation for the entire web. It helps HTTP clients, which are web browsers, send file requests to web servers in order to exchange files to open and load web pages. Once the request is accepted by the server, the user will be granted access to the information, which will be displayed on the user’s screen for them to view. HTTP relies on the TCP standard, as a TCP/IP connection is required before a file request can take place.
				</p>
			<h4>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h4>
				<p>
					TCP, is a transport layer network protocol that allows programs and devices to communicate with each other over a network. It establishes a connection between the source and destination before transmission and makes sure it remains live until the communication begins, and then breaks down large amounts of data into smaller packets, ensuring the reliable transmission of data. 
				</p>
				<h5>TCP/IP</h5>
					<p>
						TCP frequently works together with another protocol, IP, to transfer data between destinations, as a result, making a TCP/IP connection. IP provides the address of the destination, where the data is to be sent, and TCP is then responsible for the transmission of the data to that destination, once the IP address has been obtained and identified.
					</p>
			<h4>File Transfer Protocol (FTP</h4>
				<p>
					FTP, is an application layer communications protocol that is responsible for the transferring of files between a client and server. It uses a TCP/IP connection to then transmit files between computers. In an FTP transaction, both computers, usually called the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost" target="_blank" title="Local Host">local host</a>’ and the ‘<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/remote-host#:~:text=A%20computer%20that%20resides%20in,transfer%20or%20remote%20control%20operation." target="_blank" title="Remote Host">remote host</a>’ must be connected to a network, have FTP software installed, be able to transfer files via FTP, and the server must be able to run FTP services.
